At Encinal Jr. Sr. High School, we take P.R.I.D.E. in making our students lives misserable. We believe to our core that making teenages dread life as a whole, we will effectively prepare them for the real world. This year's star faculty member Ms. Kathryn Hill is a prime example of our core beliefs. We are very proud to encourige the tourmoil of young, fragile minds.
